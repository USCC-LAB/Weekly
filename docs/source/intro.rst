Welcome
*******

**Weekly** is a project which aims to automate all boring stuff in python script
without human involved. The primary scenario is about daily life of
graduated students in laboratory. Professor asks elder students to
do attendance list every week, and sending each member in laboratory mail
to inform recent matters and meeting records and so on. That's only
interesting for computers ;-)

This project is started by a misanthrope who found life is tough especially
in laboratory. All right. Let me change the aim of this project with higher
purpose. Make life easy(at least for me).

Here is also a training place for new members who access to our laboratory
(unfortunately :-( ). We request basic level of coding skills and commit
messages style. Don't be worry about that. Just send us a patch.
We don't bite :)
